# Digit Recognition
This is a program which uses Tensorflow machine learning to predict the images that you draw.

## Run Guide
1. Install all of the files and extract them.
2. Open up the guess.py file and make sure to install all required packages (pip install pygame, tensorflow, etc)
3. Run the guess.py file and enjoy (It takes like 10-20 seconds to load)

You do not need to use the ml.py file for anything it is just a representation of how I trained the machine learning model.

ALSO, the stats.txt is just there as a local storage so you can pick up from where you left off

## Controls
- Draw: Simply click in the center box to draw your number.
- Run the guessing algorithm: Press the go button or click enter on your keyboard.
- Click either yes or no depending on whether the aggorithm was correct and if not select which one you actually drew.
- Clear the canvas: Press the clear button or click the space bar on your keyboard.
- Exit the program: Click the quit button or press the q key on your keyboard.
