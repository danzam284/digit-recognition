# Digit Recognition
This is a program which uses Tensorflow machine learning to predict the images that you draw.

Disclaimer: It is not extremely accurate :(
## Run Guide
1. Install all of the files and extract them.
2. Open up the guess.py file and make sure to install all required packages (pip install pygame, tensorflow, etc)
3. Run the guess.py file and enjoy

*You do not need to use the ml.py file for anything it is just a representation of how I trained the machine learning model.

## Controls
- Draw: Simply click in the center box to draw your number.
